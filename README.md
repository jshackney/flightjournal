Pilot logbook

Relatively simply logbook idea written in C++ and utilizing SQLite for storage. Primary target is Linux systems.

I know . . . why do we need ANOTHER pilot logbook program when there are already at least three major commercial applications in the wild? Answer: none work well (if at all) with Linux. Logbook Pro uses a non-industry standard databse backend and has no use for SQL. Don't know much more about LogTen or AeroLog, however.
